# GCP Project quotas and limits
Problem describtion :
 
I'm working with a big financial institution migrating a massive work load from on-prem and other cloud platform to GCP.
after laying down the infrastucture and while more indviduals and teams start using GCP services and resources we start hitng some limtis and quotas on those projects so we got lots of automation scripts fail due to that.
To increase the quota for specific resource, customer would need to open a Support ticket with Google support which usually take 24 - 48 hours to be fixed.
